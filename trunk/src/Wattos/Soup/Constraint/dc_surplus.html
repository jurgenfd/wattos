<p>
A list of author defined distance constraints will be partitioned into the following sets:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>U Universe of all distance constraints in author deposition list.
  </li>
  <li>Q Unparsed constraints (e.g. syntax or grammar of constraint was unclear). Note
that it might be hard to know exactly how many constraints an unparsed piece of text contains.
Elements in Q exist as parse errors in STAR files.
  </li>
  <li>A Unmatched (unlinked in CCPN jargon) constraints. E.g. a constraint containing an atom
name "abracadabra". Elements in A exist as conversion errors in STAR files.
  </li>
  <li>E Exceptional constraints that according to CCPN linking are present but could not be found
by Wattos. E.g. H* for the N terminal residue H1, H2, H3. This set might be empty if all is well.
  </li>
  <li>D Double constraints. As a side effect of partitioning
constraints into this set all constraints that were not partitioned before will be simplified and
possibly combined. 
    
    <ol>

    <li>A constraint between the same atoms, say A-A is considered double. The constraint is also
        flagged as double if it has even one such pair as above. E.g. A, B-A.
    </li>
      <li>A-B, B to just A-B.<br>

        (A-B or A-B) to just A-B.<br>

        (A-B or A-C) to just A-B, C and many more complicated cases to simplify the number of pairs and atoms listed.
    </li>
      <li>A-B if there was already a constraint A-B before. Combine a constraint A-B with c_low, c_high (see Definitions below for what
c_low etc. mean) of 3, 5 Ang. with a constraint HA-HB with c_low, c_high of 4, 6 to a constraint having the tightest bounds
(representing all information in both constraints) i.e. HA-HB with c_low, c_high of 4, 5.
    </li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>I Impossible constraints. Constraints that are incompatible with the molecular topology. 
First the following corrections will be applied.
    
    <ol>

    <li>Lower bound below averaged sum of involved atom radii (e.g. 1.8) will be nilled.
    </li>
      <li>Upper bound above the diameter of the structure will be nilled.
    </li>
      <li>The above two checks will also be done for the target.
    </li>
    </ol>

Constraints that have no target and lower, and upper bound, and intensity and volume 
will be marked as impossible too. If a target is out it's range then it will simply
  be nilled.
If a model exists for the structure. The largest diameter in the first model will 
determine the t_upp for distances not in the dictionary of known theoretical distances.
The t_low is set to the sum of the vdw radii - 0.2 (e.g. 1.8 for 2 protons) if the
distance isn't found in the same dictionary. If the element type isn't known
then t_low is unknown. So neither t_low nor t_upp always exist.<br>

A node is impossible if:<br>

    <pre>(t_upp.exists &amp;&amp; c_low.exists &amp;&amp; c_low &gt; t_upp) ||<br>(t_low.exists &amp;&amp; c_upp.exists &amp;&amp; c_upp &lt; t_low) ||<br>(c_low.exists &amp;&amp; c_upp.exists &amp;&amp; c_low &gt; c_upp) ||<br>(c_tar.exists &amp;&amp; (t_low.exists &amp;&amp; (c_tar  &lt; t_low ) || (t_upp.exists &amp;&amp; c_tar &gt; t_upp )))<br></pre>

A constraint is impossible if any node is impossible.
  </li>
  <li>F Fixed constraints. Constraints between atoms that have no variability in their distance
if only dihedral angles are allowed to rotate. So:
t_low.exists &amp;&amp; t_upp.exists &amp;&amp; t_low == t_upp.
  </li>
  <li>R Redundant constraints. Constraints that don't add restrictions on the distance between
the atoms in addition to the molecular topology if only dihedral angles are allowed to rotate.
  thresholdRedundancy is introduced to allow constraints that are on the edge of
  being redundant to still be non-redundant. The usual setting is 5 %.<br>

  
    <pre>c_low.exists &amp;&amp; t_low.exists &amp;&amp; c_low &lt;= (t_low - lowTheo*thresholdRedundancy/100) then lower bound is redundant<br>c_upp.exists &amp;&amp; t_upp.exists &amp;&amp; c_upp &gt;= (t_upp + uppTheo*thresholdRedundancy/100) then upper bound is redundant<br></pre>

constraint is only redundant if all 3 distances are either not present or are redundant.
This is in contrast to the impossible constraints for which only 1 distance needs to be impossible 
in order to qualify the whole restraint as impossible.
  </li>
  <li>N Non-redundant constraints. The remaining constraints so that equation 1 (see below)
holds.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Properties_of_the_sets"></a>
Properties of the sets
</h3>
<ul>

  <li>U = Q u A u S u N <br>

Sets are mutually disjoint except with U. E.g. no element in Q is in A.
  </li>
  <li>Set S = E u C u D u I u F u R <br>

Set S doesn't add information to structure calculation and is Surplus.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>

  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">c_low</span>: lower bound distance of constraint
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">c_upp</span>: upper bound distance of constraint

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
As part of the redundancy check the components in the constraints will be somewhat ordered. Within one
member the 'smallest' atom will be the first atom. Within one
node the member with the 'smallest' atom will be the first member.
Within one constraint the node with the member with the smallest atom will be the first node (after the logical
node).
An atom is ranked the smallest if it occurs first in the model. E.g. HN of residue 1 before
HA of residue 2.
<br>

</p>
<pre>This means the following re-orderings take place:<br>    hc          -   hb   or<br>    hd, ha      -   hb<br>becomes:<br>    ha, hc, hd  -   hb<br>by:<br>-1- swapping atoms hd, ha to ha, hd, and<br>-2- combining nodes 1 and 2.<br></pre>




<p>
The ideas presented here are derived from the implementation of the redundancy checks 
that Aqua is able to perform on unambiguous constraints.
</p>
<h3><a name="Differences_with_Aqua_redundancy_check"></a>
  Differences with Aqua redundancy check</h3>
Aqua can only work with unambiguous constraints. Aqua can only use center averaging in redundancy check. The combination of
    center averaging and ambiguous constraints is not possible in Wattos
    because it doesn't make sense.<br>
<p>
    Aqua uses a cutoff distance of 1.8 Ang. instead of 2.0 Ang. in Wattos for
    the minimum theoretical distance between intra residual contacts. Wattos
    increased this because it wasn't considering constraints with exactly 1.8
    Ang as the lower bound as redundant anymore when using the default 5%
    allowance. Apparently Aqua didn't use the allowance on lower bounds but 
    it should have.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
The AQUA surplus check for unambiguous distance constraints can be performed by the AQUA
    <a href="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/%7Ejurgen/Aqua/server">server</a>. A server for the surplus
functionality of Wattos is planned for 2006.
