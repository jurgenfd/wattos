  <title>Match to Soup</title>
</head>


<body>


<h3>Outset:</h3>



Score the given restraints versus a sequence of residues and use an
alignment algorithm for determining the best matching regions.
<br>




<h3>Assumptions:</h3>



- Atoms in the constraints in the same residue are in the same residue
in the soup.<br>




- No insertion codes allowed.
<br>




- Gaps in the soup residue numbering will be penalized heavily.<br>




- Gaps in restraint residue numbering are allowed.
<br>




- All symmetry related restraints are present.
<br>




<h3>Nomenclature:</h3>




Query: sequences in restraints<br>



Subject: sequences in soup (<span id="misp_compose_2" class="hm">SEQRES</span> records of the <span id="misp_compose_3" class="hm">PDB</span>)<br>



Score:



Since there could be none, one or multiple contributions per residue the score is NOT a
probability in the classic sense even though the word is used.
<p>




[A] Match: a possible correspondence between two residues.<br>





[B] Substitutions: atom(s) from the two residues don't match and the residue needs to be
replaced by another.
Uncommon but might be useful as error correction for errors in restraints or
sequence.<br>




[C] Insertions: going from residues in restraints to residues in soup, a
residue(s) needs to be
inserted.<br>




[D] Deletions: going from restraints to soup, residues need to be
deleted. This is uncommon.<br>



</p>



<h3>Scores</h3>




Algorithm of Smith-Waterman ("Local" Alignment) needs similarity scores
that are positive for related residues and negative for substitutions,
gaps, and
unrelated residues.
<ol>

  <li>Score matrix is setup with sequential restraint residues
(query) over rows and the soup residues (subject) over columns. So
residues without restraints will never be mapped. The resulting gaps are not
    important as they will not lead to an info loss.</li>

  <li>The score contribution per unique atom (pa; probability atom) in the restraint list is 1 divided by the number
of residues in the subject sequence that it could occur in (<span id="misp_compose_6" class="hm">nf;
    number fulfilled</span>) or zero if
the atom can not be matched to any subject residue. E.g. an HA3 will be a contribution of 0.1 (assuming 10
    <span id="misp_compose_7" class="hm">Gly</span> in the soup). HB3 will be a contribution of 0.01 (assuming 100 <span id="misp_compose_8" class="hm">AMX</span>
spin systems {HB3 containing residues) in the soup). HX9 will be a
contribution of 0 (assuming no HX9 containing residues).</li>

  <li>Atom that can occur in the subject residue [A] (match) is
scored a positive contribution. But if it can not occur in the subject
residue it [B] (substitution) is scored a flat negative contribution (<span id="misp_compose_9" class="hm">cn</span>; contribution negative: -10).</li>

  <li>All atom nomenclatures on file will be considered. A match on one
of the nomenclature sets is treated the same as if it is in many.</li>

  <li>If the residue name of an atom in a restraint is known [A] it
will be used in stead of the atom's name. In this case, the score
contribution per atom is 10 divided by the number of residues in the
subject sequence that it matches or ZERO if the residue name can not be
matched to any subject residue name.</li>

  <li>Deletions [D] are not common and are kind of forbidden but can happen e.g. <span id="misp_compose_10" class="hm">PDB</span> annotation
split one author residue to two <span id="misp_compose_11" class="hm">PDB</span> residues.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>Insertions [C] in the residues in the restraints are very
common, e.g. an undefined region because of local signal
broadening.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>A jump [C] from one chain to the next in the subject (soup)
sequence is a special gap that happens.</li>

  <li>Another special gap&nbsp;[D]  is between restraint residues
(query) that are non-sequential because of a jump in sequence number to
indicate a chain jump as common in structures solved with <span id="misp_compose_12" class="hm">CYANA</span>. This
gap [D] is hard to distinguish from [C] so it will be ignored as a
separate category.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>The negative score contributions for A, B, and C are
to be determined by heuristics, e.g. -1/5, -1/2, -1.</li>

  <li>Simple constant gap (insertion and deletion) penalty
function is used.</li>

  <li>After the contributions are added from this and the violation analyses detailed below, the negative scores
(penalties) are set to zero.</li>

</ol>
<h3>



Smith-Waterman Algorithm</h3>




<ol>

  <li>Assigns a score to each pair of residues</li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>- Uses similarity scores only</li>

    <li>- Uses positive scores for related residues</li>

    <li>- Uses negative scores for substitutions and gaps</li>

  
  </ul>

  <li>Initializes edges of the matrix with zeros</li>

  <li>As the scores are summed in the matrix, any score below
0 is recorded as 0.</li>

  <li>Begins the trace back at the maximum value found
anywhere in the matrix</li>

  <li>Continues until the score falls to 0.</li>

</ol>




<br>




The modifications to the algorithm should:<br>




<ul>

  <li>Do more than one range. Iterate on the score matrix by
taking out the matched regions until
  </li>

  
  <ul>

    <li>less than MINIMAL_MATCH_LENGHT consecutive residues (mm) are left or </li>

    <li>no
positive
scores remain or </li>

  
    <li>when no matching
region don't be pick the match again in order to prevent infinite iterations.<br>



<br>



    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>



<h3>Violations</h3>



<ul>

  <li><span id="misp_compose_14" class="hm">Intra</span> residue distance and dihedral angle violations (v) over 1
    <span id="misp_compose_15" class="hm">Ang</span>. (dc; distance cutoff) and 10 degrees (ac; angle cutoff)
respectively are penalties (pp). The score contribution for the
violations (<span id="misp_compose_16" class="hm">pv</span>) will be zero if the restraint can nowhere be
accommodated.&nbsp;The score will be weighted (<span id="misp_compose_18" class="hm">wv</span>; weight of violations)
by one over the # residues that could <span id="misp_compose_19" class="hm">fulfill</span> the <span id="misp_compose_20" class="hm">intra residue</span>
restraint (<span id="misp_compose_21" class="hm">nf</span>; number fulfilled) under the threshold
    (dc or ac). Doing
so will make unique restraints more important. Violations of less than
the cutoff will get a small positive contribution. A factor 5 (<span id="misp_compose_23" class="hm">fv</span>) will
be used to scale between violations and no violations beyond the
cutoff. Another weight factor (<span id="misp_compose_24" class="hm">wo</span>=1)&nbsp; adjust this score
contribution versus the ones by the above. For distance violations, pp
will be limited to fv.</li>

  <li>E.g. for dihedral angle restraints:</li>

</ul>



v = 0 if there is no violation<br>



pp = 1-v^2/ac^2 where v &lt;= ac or<br>



pp = -<span id="misp_compose_25" class="hm">fv</span>*v^2/ac^2 otherwise<br>



<span id="misp_compose_26" class="hm">wv</span> = 1/<span id="misp_compose_27" class="hm">nf</span> where <span id="misp_compose_28" class="hm">nf</span> &gt;=1 or<br>



<span id="misp_compose_29" class="hm">wv</span> = 0 where <span id="misp_compose_30" class="hm">nf</span> = 0<br>



<span id="misp_compose_31" class="hm">pv</span> = <span id="misp_compose_32" class="hm">wv</span> * pp.<br>



<span id="misp_compose_33" class="hm">po</span> = pa + <span id="misp_compose_34" class="hm">pv</span> * <span id="misp_compose_35" class="hm">wo</span> (<span id="misp_compose_36" class="hm">po</span>; probability overall)

<h3>Examples</h3>



<ol>

  <li>A&nbsp;psi dihedral for beta region of <span id="misp_compose_37" class="hm">Ramachandran</span> plot might be violated 180 degrees but below threshold in 30 residues.<br>


    <font face="Courier">


    <span id="misp_compose_38" class="hm">pv</span> = (1/30)*-5*180^2/180^2 = &nbsp;-1/6</font><br>


The same residue has a HA3 restraint that will be 0.1 (pa) as in the example above.<br>


    <font face="Courier">


    <span id="misp_compose_39" class="hm">po</span> = -1/6 + 1/10 = -1/15<br>


    </font>


If these are the only restraints for this residue the score will be
assigned to zero before considering gap penalties. The intuitive idea
is to weigh pa and <span id="misp_compose_40" class="hm">pv</span> by <span id="misp_compose_41" class="hm">wo</span> so that they are approximately even.</li>

  <li>A distance restraint without a violation (they exist;-) and only
fulfilled in this residue (<span id="misp_compose_43" class="hm">pv</span> = 1). For the same residue a HG3 atom is
not found but at least one other residues could accommodate it.<br>


    <font face="Courier">


pa = -10 (<span id="misp_compose_45" class="hm">cn</span>)&nbsp;</font><br>
 so that:<br>


    <font face="Courier">


    <span id="misp_compose_46" class="hm">po</span> = 1 - 10 = -9.</font></li>

</ol>




<h3>Real Examples</h3>




The code here will be tested on the following examples listed in order
of complexity.
<ol>

  <li>1BRV soup has a couple extra residues N-terminal. Residue
types are known.
  </li>

  <li>1B4C <span id="misp_compose_47" class="hm">homodimer</span>.</li>
  <li>1PDT DNA/protein complex pretty complete.</li>

  <li>2FV4 dimer with many gaps in restraints.
  </li>

  <li>1OLG <span id="misp_compose_48" class="hm">homotetramer</span>.
  </li>

  <li>1B4Y DNA with 5 chains in the restraints but only 1 chain
in soup. Quite likely to be impossible to get right.
  </li>

  <li>2FFW protein with 2 Zn ions. Impossible to guess which Zn
is which without
looking at distance violations on anything but <span id="misp_compose_49" class="hm">intra</span> residue
restraints.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>1AUD DNA/protein complex with restraint chain ids of &quot;&quot; and
    &quot;str1&quot; for the same chain.. Might be impossible.</li>

</ol>
<h3>Output</h3>
The target is to generate STAR formatted output that can automatically
be used to do the mapping. An example file with the combined
adjustments needed by several PDB entries can be found in Wattos
subdirectory: Wattos\data\test_data\restraint_map.str. The main loop
for example entry 1PDT reads:<br>
<pre>    loop_
       _Auth_segment_code
       _Auth_seq_ID
       _Label_entity_assembly_ID
       _Label_comp_index_ID

       S1 1 1 1 
       S2 1 2 9 
    stop_
</pre>
Which maps restraints in S1 to the first and S2 to the second chain. The old residue 1
in S2 will have a&nbsp; new residue number 9 in the second chain.
