  <title>The database package</title>
</head>



  <body>
A framework for handling millions of 'objects' efficiently in Java by using
non-redundant Java Objects wherever possible. 
The relations between the objects should be usable to
do many things automatical. E.g. delete the children of a parent if that's
the violent policy in place;-)
<p>Columns may contain null values (like <code>Defs.NULL_INT</code>) at every row. Null values are defined values 
within the range of the variable. E.g. the null value for an int is the maximum
value of an int minus 1. When a column is a foreign key constraint (fkc) to another relation, the fkc has
an attribute of whether or not the column can contain nulls. A fkc column that
can't be nullable but does contains a null will lead to an inconsistency in the database
that can be checked for with a method within the fkcSet class.
  </p>
<p>
Support is present for:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>Foreign key constraints (fkc) on primary indices although the enforcement
    of these constraints is not necessarily done in order to maintain a good 
    speed.
  </li>
  <li>fkc checking
  </li>
  <li>An organized set of tables with related info. E.g. the <code>Wattos.Soup.Constraint.DistConstr</code> is a collection of
  five tables with information on restraint atoms, members, nodes, and violations.
  </li>
  <li>Objects as elements of the table in addition to simple types
    like native items int, and floats.
  </li>
  <li>For strings there is the option to only store the actual string once
    per column (others will be references).
  </li>
  <li>Automatic growing of a table 
  </li>
  <li>Cascading delete (delete children when parents are deleted).</li>
  <li>Serilization&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


  
<p>
It doesn't yet support:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>your request here...<br>
  </li>
</ul>


  
<p>
Not planned to support:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>Automatic shrinking of a table and updating other tables through fkcs&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Concurrent updates/deletes
  </li>
  <li>Roll back, etc.
  </li>
</ul>
