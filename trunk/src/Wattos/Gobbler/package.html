This partition contains the conversion programs and the objects specific for
describing the results from Blast, i.e. all the BlastMatch classes.

The CSV files put out by Wattos follow the following syntax:

<P>for each query identifier set (usually just 1):
<UL>
<LI>orf_db_name
<LI>orf_db_id
<LI>orf_db_subid
<LI>molecule_name
</UL>

<P>followed by:
<UL>
<LI> bit_score
<LI>  bit_score_maximum
<LI>  expectation_value
<LI>  match_size
<LI>  number_gaps
<LI>  number_identities
<LI>  number_positives
<LI>  query_orf_length (full length query)
<LI>  query_orf_match_start
<LI>  query_orf_sequence (Only the part that's matched)
<LI>  query_is_positive_strand (only significant for nucleotides; true/false)
<LI>  subject_orf_length (the whole sequence; not just the matched part)
<LI>  subject_orf_match_start
<LI>  subject_orf_sequence (Only the part that's matched)
<LI>  subject_is_positive_strand (only significant for nucleotides; true/false)
</UL>

<P>and then for each subject identifier set (usually just 1)
<UL>
<LI>orf_db_name
<LI>orf_db_id
<LI>orf_db_subid
<LI>molecule_name
</UL>
