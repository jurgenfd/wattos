<P>Parser for X-PLOR, CNS, Aria, and XPLOR-NIH formatted restraint files.
</p>
  <P>
The only source files here that were created by humans are the java source files:
StarOut.java  and Utils.java and the JavaCC grammar file XplorParser.jj. All other
files are (re-)generated using JavaCC Parser Generator.

<P> Examples of input are:
<PRE>
ASSI { 6} (( segid "SH3 " and resid 53 and name HA )) (( segid "SH3 " and resid 53 and name HE1 )) 3.600 1.700 1.700 peak 6 weight 0.10000E+01 volume 0.14383E-02 ppm1 4.578 ppm2 9.604 CV 1 
  OR { 6} (( segid "SLP " and resid 83 and name HB )) (( segid "SH3 " and resid 53 and name HE1 ))
</PRE>

  <P>
  TO DO:
  <OL>
  <LI>For entry 1naj there are RDCs with 3 important atoms which aren't caught yet.
  <LI>For entry 1ttv there are atom names that start with '*' and the parser 
  falsely considers it an error. 
<LI>For entry 2a55 there are RDCs with only 2 atoms that aren't parsable yet.
