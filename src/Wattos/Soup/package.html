<p>This package contains Java code specific to the molecular
objects in a soup. (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=whatif+homepage">WHAT IF</a>
jargon)
</p>

<p>For the specific entities like atom, residue, molecule, etc.
look in
the <code>Atom</code>
class for the most complete documentation.
</p>

<p>
The Atoms class is the basic object which is optimized to deal with
many atoms.
The classes above it (like <code>Residue/Molecule/Ensemble/Gumbo</code>)
organize the atoms in a
more object-oriented fashion. The classes like {@link Wattos.Soup.Atom}
use primitive data types and non-redundant strings as made possible by
the {@link Wattos.Database} package in order to
prevent the generation of many objects like Strings which is
inefficient in Java beyond the order of a thousand or so.
</p>

<p>
Recap of the order with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mmCIF">mmCIF</a>
and NMR-STAR equivalents<br>

</p>

<pre>-@-1- Atom Atom<br>-:-2- Residue Chemical Component<br>-#-3- Molecule Entity<br>-~-4- Model Assembly<br>-^-5- Entry Same<br>---6- DBMS Same<br></pre>

<p>
Everything is in one soup (called Gumbo in Wattos).
</p>

<p>
In the future a parser will be implemented that can be used to do
things like: "make an atom taste good" (in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=MOLMOL">MOLMOL</a>
jargon): </p>

<pre>SetProperty @Atom:Residue#Molecule^Ensemble 'jummie'</pre>

<p>
Estimated maximum number of atoms in the gumbo
</p>

<pre>-@-1- Atom<br>-:-2- Residue has 20 atoms (including pseudo atoms) 10,000,000 atoms<br>-#-3- Molecule has 100 residues (ions will be a residue when bound) 500,000 residues<br>-~-4- Model has 10 molecules (e.g. multimer) 5,000 molecules<br>-^-5- Entry has 50 500 models<br>---6- DBMS has 10 entries 10 entry<br></pre>

<p>
Total 10,000,000 atoms for biggest and most complex case above.
Reading/writing/etc. of such quantities is a matter of seconds in
Wattos.</p>
