  <P>
API to quickly parse/unparse generic large STAR files like those
in the NMR-STAR and mmCIF sub formats. This package has very little
specific functionality for either format. Look in package NMRStar for 
more specific support.<BR>
Here support is present for data blocks, saveframes, and unnested loops (tables).<BR>
It doesn't yet support:
<UL>
<LI>global block
<LI>multiple data blocks
<LI>dictionary.
</ul>

Not planned to support nested loops.

<BR>
Benchmark testing:
<ul>
<LI>Tested on a Pentium IV of 1.6 MHz (cod.bmrb.wisc.edu) with 1 Gb.
<LI>JProfiler was used to identify bottlenecks.

<LI>Loading coordinate section of mmCIF formatted file for PDB entry 1VRE
    (BMRB entry 4096). For the test it is modeled as having about 10
    columns of which half are numbers and half are strings.
    The file is 6.5 Mb and contains 29 models and 2177 atoms per model. 
    That's ~60,000 atoms times 10 columns or 500,000 objects.
    Modelling the components above will be done later.
    The reading proceeds in the following steps:
    <OL>
    <LI>Parsing into a STAR tagtable object
    <LI>Parse the strings to native types
    <LI>Unparse
    </OL></LI>
    </ul>
