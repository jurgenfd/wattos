The relationlist type is a match for the sf category.,,
Tag names have to be ordered by appearance.,,
If no attribute is specified it will be taken exactly the same as the tagname.,,
The 'data type Java' column defines an automatic conversion that can be done on the STAR file upon reading in.,,
%q adds a space to a value so the value will be quoted in star (todo),,
%yesno will transform a boolean into yes or no.,,

Not all tags are modelled here:,,
,Assumed tags like:,_Dist_constraint_tree.Entry_ID
,,_Dist_constraint_tree.Distance_constraint_list_ID
