MenuSub0,MenuSub1,MenuSub2,MenuSub3,Command,Keyboard_shortcut,Description,Help_html,Example_html
Notes:,All commands have a case-insensitive unique name that is a primary key into this table.,,,,,,The help is actually cut-and-pasted from the code base.,
,Menus have to have different names than commands because they are used to switch into a submenu.,,,,,,,
,Commands do not need to be in a submenu.,,,,,,,
,"Keyboard shortcuts are meant for the GUI, not for the UI.",,,,,,,
,Menus can be empty,,,,,,,
,The menu are based on MOLMOL by Reto Koradi.,,,,,,,
,Longest command name is ExecuteStandard with 14 chars. Keep names short and abbreviated where needed to fit maximum of 16 chars.,,,,,,,
,Longest menu name can be 8 characters,,,,,,,
,Commands are selection based for the most part. E.g. CalcNOECompl will calculated the completeness of NOEs that have been selected in selected entries.,,,,,,,
,The order in which the commands are listed is the order in which they will appear in the overall menu. Don't start a mainmenu item more than once.,,,,,,,
,Commands can not be empty strings.,,,,,,,
TBL_BEGIN,,,,,,,,X
File,Read,Entry,,ReadEntryNMRSTAR,,Reads an NMR-STAR formatted BMRB entry,"The types of data that will be read will depend on what is available and what is selected.
