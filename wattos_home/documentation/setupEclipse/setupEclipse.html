Furthermore make sure no other tomcat servers are running. On Mac OSX:
<PRE>
/~/ ps -A | grep -i java

To get rid of the -red cross- thru the whole Wattos project in the explorer make sure:
<PRE>
Properties for Wattos
    Project Facets
        Project Facets
            DISABLE WebDoclet (XDoclet) 1.2.3
</PRE>

To get Ant to work with scp install com.jcraft.jsch_0.1.131.jar as directed by Ant.<BR>
I used the ~/.ant/lib location.         
It will show up under Eclipse/Preference/Ant/Runtime/Classpath/Global entries.
</LI>
<LI>
The following 91 warnings are left. I have filtered for trivial ones that for this image were filtered out by
filtering on "is ever". Normally I leave all 91 warnings available as to catch as much as possible. Of the 14, 11 are trivial warnings in 
code autogenerated by JavaCC and 3 are tags that Eclipse WPT validator doesn't know about.
<p>Main point it that no errors are present anymore after these configurations; hoera!</p>

                wattos/build/web/WEB-INF/classes
