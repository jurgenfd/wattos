# Wattos properties 
#In the file, each property definition is of the form property_name = value. 
#The pound symbol (#) at the start of a line in the file indicates a comment line. 
#Use the forward slash (/) as a directory delimiter for all the file path names.
#If the backward slash (\) is needed (like on Windows), a replacement will be done for you automatically. 

# Give boolean values as true or false
