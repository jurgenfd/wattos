Description of the tags in this list:
*  1 * NMR-STAR 3 administrative tag
*  2 * NMR-STAR 3 administrative tag
*  3 * NMR-STAR 3 administrative tag
*  4 * Number of triplets (atom-group pair and pseudo)
*  5 * Number of triplets that were swapped
*  6 * Percentage of triplets that were swapped
*  7 * Number of deassigned triplets
*  8 * Percentage of deassigned triplets
*  9 * Number of models in ensemble
* 10 * Energy of the states with the lower energies summed for all triplets (Ang.**2)
* 11 * Energy of the states with the higher energies summed for all triplets (Ang.**2)
* 12 * Item 9-8
* 13 * Criterium for swapping assignment on the absolute energy difference (Ang.**2)
* 14 * Criterium for swapping assignment on the relative energy difference (Ang.**2)
* 15 * Criterium for swapping assignment on the percentage of models favoring a swap
* 16 * Criterium for deassignment on a single model violation (Ang.)
* 17 * Criterium for deassignment on a multiple model violation (Ang.)
* 18 * Criterium for deassignment on a percentage of models
* 19 * this tag

Description of the tags in the table below:
*  1 * Chain identifier (can be absent if none defined)
*  2 * Residue number
*  3 * Residue name
*  4 * Name of pseudoatom representing the triplet
*  5 * Ordinal number of assignment (1 is assigned first)
*  6 * 'yes' if assignment state is swapped with respect to restraint file
*  7 * Percentage of models in which the assignment with the lowest
        overall energy is favoured
*  8 * Percentage of difference between lowest and highest overall energy
        with respect to the highest overall energy
*  9 * Difference between lowest and highest overall energy
* 10 * Energy of the highest overall energy state (Ang.**2)
* 11 * Energy of the lowest overall energy state (Ang.**2)
* 12 * Number of restraints involved with the triplet. The highest ranking
        triplet on this number, is assigned first
* 13 * Number of restraints involved with the triplet that are ambiguous
        besides the ambiguity from this triplet
* 14 * 'yes' if restraints included in this triplet are deassigned
* 15 * Maximum unaveraged violation before deassignment (Ang.)
* 16 * Number of violated restraints above threshold for a single model
        before deassignment (given by 
       _Stereo_assignments.Violation_single_model_criterium_count)
* 17 * Number of violated restraints above threshold for a multiple models
        before deassignment (given by 
       _Stereo_assignments.Violation_multi_model_criterium_count)
* 18 * NMR-STAR 3.0 administrative tag
* 19 * NMR-STAR 3.0 administrative tag
